	abstract = {Some new properties associated with the special class of integer programs known as weighted set covering problems are derived. While it is well known that an optimal integer solution to the set covering problem is a basic feasible solution to the corresponding linear program, we show that there exists an optimal basis which is involutory (i.e., B = B-1). This property and others are used to develop a new algorithm which uses strong cutting planes. The cutting planes are strong in the sense that they exclude both integer and noninteger solutions. Computational experience is presented.},

	abstract = {This study shows how the problem of optimally selecting files for extracting from an overlapping, multiple file data storage system can be treated as an integer programming problem and solved by means of existing integer programming computer routines. It presents several heuristic file selection problems and suggests how existing integer programming routines could be used in an extracting system. The study concludes that the integer programming formulation is a feasible means of expressing the file selection problem and that existing computer programs may afford useful methods of solution. The file selection problem gives an especially simple integer programming problem; available algorithms, modified to account for this simple structure may be expected to eliminate any chance of failure in operation.},

	abstract="A conditional lower bound on the minimand of an integer program is a number which would be a valid lower bound if the constraint set were amended by certain inequalities, also called conditional. If such a conditional lower bound exceeds some known upper bound, then every solution better than the one corresponding to the upper bound violates at least one of the conditional inequalities. This yields a valid disjunction, which can be used to partition the feasible set, or to derive a family of valid cutting planes. In the case of a set covering problem, these cutting planes are themselves of the set covering type. The family of valid inequalities derived from conditional bounds subsumes as a special case the Bellmore-Ratliff inequalities generated via involutory bases, but is richer than the latter class and contains considerably stronger members, where strength is measured by the number of positive coefficients. We discuss the properties of the family of cuts from conditional bounds, and give a procedure for generating strong members of the family. Finally, we outline a class of algorithms based on these cuts. Our approach was implemented and extensively tested in a computational study whose results are reported in a companion paper [2]. The algorithm that emerged from the testing seems capable of solving considerably larger set covering problem than earlier methods.",

abstract="We report on the implementation and computational testing of several versions of a set covering algorithm, based on the family of cutting planes from conditional bounds discussed in the companion paper [2]. The algorithm uses a set of heuristics to find prime covers, another set of heuristics to find feasible solutions to the dual linear program which are needed to generate cuts, and subgradient optimization to find lower bounds. It also uses implicit enumeration with some new branching rules. Each of the ingredients was implemented and tested in several versions. The variant of the algorithm that emerged as best was run on 55 randomly generated test problems (20 of them from the literature), with up to 200 constraints and 2000 variables. The results show the algorithm to be more reliable and efficient than earlier procedures on large, sparse set covering problems.",
